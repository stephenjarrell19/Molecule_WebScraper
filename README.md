# Molecule_WebScraper
## THIS PROGRAM IS DEPRECATED DUE TO CHANGES IN APEXBIO's HTML.
### Summary:
I created my own web-scraping program in Python which parses HTML source information from a public pharmaceutical webpage, ApexBio. The program takes an excel document with thousands of compound names and downloads an image for each compound. After parsing for the image tags and source information on the website, the program automatically downloads the image files for every 2D molecular structure in the list of compounds, labels it accordingly, and saves it to the desired directory. 

### Purpose:
I made this project after grabbing a burger with my friend Dhillip Raman on campus. Dhillip was explaining his internship at a laboratory to me and how the menial task of manually downloading thousands of molecular images was consuming his time and restricting his opportunities there. I jokingly suggested that I could automate it... but I ended up doing so! This program was designed to help my friend.
